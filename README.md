Go exercises corresponding with a python book


About:
This is how I taught myself Go as an almost first language.  When I was learning Go there was nothing for people who didn't already
know at least one other programming language.  I had gone through Learn Python The Hard Way (2.7) by Zed Shaw partially a couple
years before this and wanted to start teaching myself how to code again.  I wanted to learn Go as there was a code challenge I 
wanted to do and the company mainly used Go. So I re-taught myself Python using the book and for each chapter/lesson I also figured 
out how to do the same thing in Go if it was possible.  I did not do the whole book but went far enough to start working towards 
the code challenge (which is in another project).  These are the files in Go for each lesson I did.
